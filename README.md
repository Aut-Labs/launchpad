# Āut Expander

Āut Expander is the main product of our product suite.

By integrating it, you can expand your DAO contract - adding the concepts of Members Roles & Interactions directly on-chain, at contract level.
Assign Roles to your Community - and kick off role-based working routines and role-weighted governance in seconds.
